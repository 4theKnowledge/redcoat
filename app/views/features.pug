		h2 Upcoming features

		h3 Pre-release
		
		p The features below have yet to be added to Redcoat and will be added prior to release. The features are listed in descending order of importance.

		ul
			li.done Correct presentation of "Your projects" and "Projects you've joined" on the Projects page (it is currently randomised)
			li Save annotation results to the database so the project creator may download them
			li "Overlap" between annotators, so each document may be annotated more than once
			li A progress bar on the annotation interface so users know how many documents remain
			li A list of annotators on the Project summary page	
			li Distribute annotation projects to annotators via email
				ul
					li An "invitation system" whereby Redcoat automatically sends invitations to users upon a project's creation, for them to accept or decline
					li Integration with Sendgrid or other automated mailing service
					// The invitation system just needs a new Invitation schema with two fields: email and project_id
					// No need for user_id, as email is unique as well (remember to put index on it)
					// Can retrieve all a User's invitations with a simple query (find all invitation where email = user.email)
					// A mailer will send out email invitations to users upon a project's creation. If the email already exists, invitation
					// may look different (i.e. "You have been invited to annotate project '...', click here to accept or decline the invitation" vs "You have been invited to annotate project '...', click here to sign up to Redcoat to begin annotating").
					// Upon accepting an Invitation, the user_id of the accepting user is added to the project's user_ids array, and that invitation is destroyed
					// (declining an invitation simply destroys that invitation).
			li Password reset link			

		h3 Post-release

		p The features below will be added after the initial release (listed in descending order of importance).
		ul
			li User profile page
			li Modify project settings on the Project summary page
			li Automatic tagging of frequently-tagged words
			li More concept hierarchies, such as medical
			li Visualisation of annotation results for project creators
			li Visualisation of annotator activity on Project page
			li Modify category hierarchy during annotation
			li Links to most recently-annotated projects under "Projects" in the navigation bar
			li Support for the annotation of other NLP tasks, such as Lexical Normalisation
			li Gamification, i.e. the ability to earn "points" during annotation and increase ranking
